* Dateutils
 [[https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/]]
 
 The dateutil module provides powerful extensions to the standard datetime module, available in Python.
 
 
** Features
+ Computing of relative deltas (next month, next year, next monday, last week of month, etc);
+ Computing of relative deltas between two given date and/or datetime objects;
+ Computing of dates based on very flexible recurrence rules, using a superset of the iCalendar specification. Parsing of RFC strings is supported as well.
+ Generic parsing of dates in almost any string format;
+ Timezone (tzinfo) implementations for tzfile(5) format files (/etc/localtime, /usr/share/zoneinfo, etc), TZ environment string (in all known formats), iCalendar format files, given ranges (with help from relative deltas), local machine timezone, fixed offset timezone, UTC timezone, and Windows registry-based time zones.
+ Internal up-to-date world timezone information based on Olson?s database.
+ Computing of Easter Sunday dates for any given year, using Western, Orthodox or Julian algorithms.

** Python to CL examples

Similary to Python let's start with importing required libraries:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :exports source :results silent
(ql:quickload :local-time)
(ql:quickload :local-time-duration)

(use-package :local-time)
#+END_SRC

Store some values:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(defparameter *now* (now))
(defparameter *today* (today))

(list *now* *today*)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| @2018-01-03T13:55:03.459745Z | @2018-01-03T00:00:00.000000Z |

Next month
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(timestamp+ *now* 1 :month)
;; or 
(adjust-timestamp *now* (offset :month 1))
#+END_SRC   

#+RESULTS:
: @2018-02-03T13:55:03\.459745Z

Next month, plus one week
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp *now* (offset :month 1) (offset :day 7))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2018-02-10T13:55:03\.459745Z

Next month, plus one week, at 10am.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp *now* (offset :month 1) (offset :day 7) (set :hour 10))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2018-02-10T10:55:03\.459745Z

Setting specific time fields similar to absolute relativedelta:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp *now* (set :year 1) (set :month 1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @0001-01-03T13:55:03\.459745+01:00

Get the relative delta
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(ltd:timestamp-difference (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 1 1 2018) *now*)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #<LOCAL-TIME-DURATION:DURATION [-2/-50103/-459745000]  -2 days -13 hours -55 minutes -3 seconds -459745000 nsecs>

One month before one year.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp *now* (offset :year 1) (offset :month -1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2018-12-03T13:55:03\.459745Z

How does it handle months with different numbers of days? Notice that adding one month will never cross the month boundary.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 27 1 2003) (offset :month 1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2003-02-27T00:00:00\.000000Z

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 31 1 2003) (offset :month 1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2003-02-28T00:00:00\.000000Z

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 31 1 2003) (offset :month 2))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2003-03-31T00:00:00\.000000+01:00

The logic for years is the same, even on leap years.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 28 2 2000) (offset :year 1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2001-02-28T00:00:00\.000000Z

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 29 2 2000) (offset :year 1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2001-02-28T00:00:00\.000000Z

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 28 2 1999) (offset :year 1))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 1 3 1999) (offset :year 1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2000-03-01T00:00:00\.000000Z

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 28 2 2001) (offset :year -1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2000-02-28T00:00:00\.000000Z

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 1 3 2001) (offset :year -1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2000-03-01T00:00:00\.000000Z

Next Friday
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp *today* (offset :day-of-week :friday))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2018-01-05T00:00:00\.000000Z

Last Friday of the month
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(defun set-day-of-week (time day-of-week) 
  "Adjust the timestamp to be the specifed day of the week, selects corresponding preceeding date if timestamp's day of the week do not match the requirement."
  (let ((adjusted (adjust-timestamp time (offset :day-of-week day-of-week))))
    (if (timestamp>= time adjusted)
        adjusted
        (adjust-timestamp adjusted (offset :day -7)))))

(set-day-of-week (timestamp-maximize-part *today* :day) :friday)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2018-01-26T23:59:59\.999999Z

Next Wednesday (it's today!)

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(defun next-day-of-week (time day-of-week) 
  "Adjust the timestamp to be the next specifed day of the week, selects corresponding future date if timestamp's day of the week do not match the requirement."
  (let ((adjusted (adjust-timestamp time (offset :day-of-week day-of-week))))
    (if (timestamp>= adjusted time)
        adjusted
        (adjust-timestamp adjusted (offset :day 7)))))

(let ((*today* (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 3 1 2018)))
  (next-day-of-week *today* :wednesday))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2018-01-03T00:00:00\.000000Z

Next wednesday, but not today.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(let ((*today* (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 3 1 2018)))
  (next-day-of-week (adjust-timestamp *today* (offset :day 1)) :wednesday))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: @2018-01-10T00:00:00\.000000Z

Following [[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html][ISO year week number notation]] find the first day of the 15th week of 1997.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(set-day-of-week

      (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 1 1 1997)
      :thursday)
   (offset :day (* 7 14)))
 :monday)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

How long ago has the millennium changed?
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(ltd:timestamp-difference *now* (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 1 1 2001))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

It works with dates too.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(ltd:timestamp-difference *today* (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 1 1 2001))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #<LOCAL-TIME-DURATION:DURATION [6211/0/0] 887 weeks 2 days>

Obtain a date using the yearday:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(adjust-timestamp (timestamp-minimize-part *now* :day) (offset :day 260))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Leap year vs non-leap year:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp 
(let ((leap (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 1 1 2000))
      (non-leap (encode-timestamp 0 0 0 0 1 1 2002)))

If you wanted to pass key1=value1 and key2=value2 to httpbin.org/get, you would use the following code:
#+begin_src lisp
(let ((payload '(("key1" . "value1") ("key2" . "value2"))))
  (multiple-value-bind (body status headers uri connection) 
      (dexador:get (quri:make-uri :defaults "https://httpbin.org/get" :query payload))
    uri))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #<QURI.URI.HTTP:URI-HTTPS https://httpbin.org/get?key1=value1&key2=value2>

You can also pass a list of items as a value:
#+begin_src lisp
(let ((payload '(("key1" . "value1") ("key2" . "value2") ("key2" . "value3"))))
  (multiple-value-bind (body status headers uri connection)
      (dexador:get (quri:make-uri :defaults "https://httpbin.org/get" :query payload))
    uri))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #<QURI.URI.HTTP:URI-HTTPS https://httpbin.org/get?key1=value1&key2=value2&key2=value3>
